4. git fetch: git fetch is used for downloading updated changes from remote repository branch to intermediatory branch called "origin/branch_name"

command: 

local master> git fetch origin master // fetch changes from remote repo branch to intermediatory branch "origin/master"
local master> git merge origin/master  // merge changes origin/master to master

Note: If you are trying fetch changes from remote branch(master) which is same as local branch(master) then fetch + merge method is referred.
